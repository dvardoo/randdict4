# Intro
Got frustrated by bad password policies forcing user to remember complex password containing different different character types (lowers, uppers, symbols and digits.
The problem with these types of policies is the fact that users have a hard time remembering these types of password containing different groups of characters, and thus tends to create easily guessed password like “Summ3r!!” to actually remember the passwords. 

Wrote these two small scripts to instead create passphrases containing 4 random words in lowers only to create strong passwords without complicating it for users.

## randdict4.py
English version of the script. Generates 4 random words as a passphrase.

## randswedict4.py
Swedish verion of the script. Generates 4 random words as a passphrase.
